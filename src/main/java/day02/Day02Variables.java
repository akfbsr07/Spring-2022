    /* Data Types in Java
       1)Primitive Data Types:
       i)Those data types were created by Java, we cannot create any primitive data type
       ii)Primitive data types are 8
         a)byte-short-int-long-float-double / char-boolean
           char: It is for single characters like A, h, ?, ! etc.
           boolean: Ä°t is for true-false values

           byte: It is used for the values from -128 to 127 for whole numbers
           short: It is used for the values from -32.000 sth to 32.000 sth for whole numbers
           int: It is used for the values from -2 billion sth to 2 billion sth for whole numbers
           long: It is used for the values from -............ to ................ for whole values. (very large no need to know)

           float: It is used for decimals. Float uses less memory than double.
                  When you create float as data type you have to put 'F' or 'f' at the end.
                  Float has 7 digits at most in decimal part.

           double: It is used for decimals. It is used for scientific researches.
                   Double has 16 digits at most in decimal part.

     /*2)Non-Primitive Data Types:
        i)Those data types can be created by Java and Java Developers
        String is a non-primitive data type
        String data type is used for multiple characters

        Note: What is the difference between "primitive" and "non-primitive" data types?
        Answer: There are 4 main differences;
              i)"primitive" data types start with lowercases, "non-primitive" data types start with uppercases
              ii)"primitive" data types can be created just by java not by developers, "non-primitive" data types can be created by Java and Java developers
              iii)"primitive" data types use different type of memory.But "non-primitive" data types all use same memory
              iiii)"primitive" data types just have values in it but "non-primitive" data types have values and methods in it.
